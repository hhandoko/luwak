* Used [kotlin-dropwizard](https://github.com/benoj/kotlin-dropwizard) template to bootstrap the project. It offers
  sensible default libraries whilst keeping it simple. Some of the dependencies are a few minor versions behind, could
  be updated on future commit(s).
* Used the demo from [polymer-webpack-loader](https://github.com/webpack-contrib/polymer-webpack-loader) for Webpack
  support for Polymer. Some minor modifications were done to update the source and output path to match Java project
  structure.
