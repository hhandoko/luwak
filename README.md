# Kopi Luwak

`luwak` is an experimentation with [Dropwizard], [Kotlin], and [Polymer].

## Usage

* `gradle run` to run the application from the command line
* `gradle build` to compile a jar (to run with `java -jar <build jar> server`)

## Contributing

We follow the "[fork-and-pull]" Git workflow.

1. Fork the repo on GitHub
1. Commit changes to a branch in your fork (use `snake_case` convention):
   * For technical chores, use `chore/` prefix followed by the short description, e.g. `chore/do_this_chore`
   * For new features, use `feature/` prefix followed by the feature name, e.g. `feature/feature_name`
   * For bug fixes, use `bug/` prefix followed by the short description, e.g. `bug/fix_this_bug`
1. Ensure relevant test(s) are added: for bugs, or if existing behaviour are changed or updated
1. Rebase or merge from "upstream"
1. Submit a PR "upstream" with your changes
